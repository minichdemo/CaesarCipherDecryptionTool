# Build a Caesar Cipher Decryption Tool
Unencrypted data can be intercepted by corporate thieves. Encryption makes data more private but simple encryption is vulnerable to ‚ÄúBrute Force‚Äù attacks that use trial and error to crack secret messages.

The [Caesar Cipher](https://learncryptography.com/classical-encryption/caesar-cipher) is one of the simplest forms of encryption. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the original message (called the plaintext) is replaced with a letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down in the alphabet. Caesar Ciphers are especially vulnerable to "brute force" attacks that use trial and error to decode encrypted data. In this lab we will use Microsoft Excel to build a spreadsheet that we help us to use "brute force" to decrypt ("crack") secret messages that were encrypted with a Caesar Cipher.

### Modulus
Modulus is a type of arithmetic useful in encryption (and lots more!). We'll use modulus in building our decryption tool. Remember how you did division in grade school? For example, if you were to divide 8 by 5, you would get two answers a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 3.

Modulus gives the remainder when we are dividing two integers. There is also another way to think of modulus. Sometimes modulus is called *clock arithmetic*. Go to [https://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/31/puzzle/1](https://studio.code.org/s/allthethings/stage/31/puzzle/1) and experiment with the Modulo Clock Widget. Here's how 8 divided by 5 looks on the clock widget.

Then see if you can answer these questions on your own *without* using the widget. HINT: all of these are kind of easy if you understand how Modulus works - don't be fooled by the big number on the first one:
* 24 MOD 817234
* 24 MOD 23
* 15 MOD 4   

Now that you understand modulus, we can build our decryption tool.   

### Step 1: Fill the numbers 65 - 90 in series (ASCII codes for A through Z)
Start by creating a new spreadsheet in Excel. Choose *Excel | Blank Workbook*. Then we will use Excels "fill handle" to place the numbers 65 - 90 in series. Type `65` in cell `A2` and `66` in cell `B2`. Highlight that pair of cells, right click on the little black box at the right bottom of cell `B2` (called the "fill handle") and drag to the right to `fill series` to cell `Z2` as shown below.

### Step 2: Write a formula to convert numbers to ASCII characters
Now we'll write a formula in cell `A3` to convert `65` to its ASCII character. Enter the formula `=CHAR(A2)` then left click on the fill handle at the bottom right of cell `A3` and fill through cell `Z3` as shown below.

### Step 3: Create a `shift` variable
Now we are going to add a variable so we can introduce different amounts of "shift." Click on cell `A1` and right above it change 'A1' to 'shift'.

### Step 4: Write a formula that uses `shift`
Now click on cell `A5`. We are going to write a formula `=A2+shift`

Now left click on the bottom right of cell `A3` and fill through cell `Z3` as shown below.

### Step 5: Write a formula to convert the shifted numbers to ASCII characters
Now we'll write a formula in cell `A4` to convert the values in row 5 below to the corresponding ASCII character. Enter the formula `=CHAR(A5)` then left click on the bottom right of cell `A4` and fill through cell `Z4` as shown below.

### Step 6: Change the amount of `shift`
Now lets type something in cell `A1` to introduce some `shift`. Type `5` in cell `A1`, hit enter, and see what happens. It should look like the screen below.

### Step 7: Use `MOD` to wrap the letters back to `A`
The problem is that after the number `90` we "run out" of letters of the alphabet. We are going to use the modulus function to "wrap the numbers" back to 65 to start at the beginning of the alphabet. In cell `A5` change the formula to `=65 +MOD(A2+shift-65,26)` and then left click in the bottom right corner and fill to cell `Z5`. The result should look like the picture below.

### Step 8: Test your decryption tool
Now enter the following secret message on row 7 one character per cell: SJB NUMTSJ KTW TSJ DJFW 

Type the following code to translate the secret message in cell `A8`: `=LOOKUP(A7,$A$3:$Z$3,$A$4:$Z$4)` and click and drag of the right bottom of cell `A8` and fill through all the cells under the secret message. Enter 21 in cell `A1` for the amount of `shift`.
